# sig-public-good-operations

This is the repository for the Sigstore Public Good Operations Special Interest Group (SIG).

## Mission

We are a group of volunteer engineers from various companies collaborating to operate and maintain the Sigstore Public Good instance.

## Projects

The sig-ops group primarily focuses on running the public good infrastructure. While not the primary focus, our work overlaps with the following projects:

- [helm-charts](https://github.com/sigstore/helm-charts)
- [scaffolding](https://github.com/sigstore/scaffolding)
- [sigstore-probers](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-probers)
- [policy-controller](https://github.com/sigstore/policy-controller)
